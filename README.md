# Instructions - TODO Utility class questions

  1. Create a class called _Numbers_

Numbers should have a contstructor with 2 parameters, both integers, which creates an array with the numbers from _start_ (the first parameter) to _end_ (the second parameter), all integers.

Numbers second constructor should take in a single integer as a parameter, and create an array with the numbers from _zero_ to the given number (all integers).

Numbers should also have a default constructor (no parameters) that creates and array with the numbers from _zero_ to _ten_.

Create 3 methods:

randomNumber - returns a random number from the array
randomEvenNumber - return a random even number from the array
randomOddNumber - returns a random odd number from the array

Use the random Class to be able to get random numbers for your methods.
